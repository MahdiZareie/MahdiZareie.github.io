            <p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 140%;">
                Hello! I'm Mahdi Zareie, and I've been fortunate to work in the software industry for over a decade. During this time, I've had the opportunity to specialize in designing software architecture for high-scale applications, striving to ensure they run smoothly and efficiently. <br/>   
            I have some experience with data pipelines and enjoy setting up and managing robust systems that ensure data flows seamlessly. I'm also quite thorough when it comes to operational topics like infrastructure as a service (IaaS), observability, and creating on-call processes for teams. I believe in paying attention to the details to ensure everything is in place and functioning well.<br/>
            I find great joy in working on optimization problems, constantly looking for ways to make systems run faster and more efficiently. In my spare time, I enjoy reading about software security, computation theory, and mathematics, especially category theory. These subjects fascinate me and keep me engaged in continuous learning.<br/>
            Outside of the tech world, I have a keen interest in politics and history. I'm always eager to explore topics that help me understand why humans are the way they are. This curiosity extends to anything that offers insights into human behavior and societal development<br/>
